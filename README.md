# cnft-pavia-tools

Get price info on pavia.io lands!

## Installation
- This was hacked together in Visual Studio .Net, so you need that to build it or grab the Windows executable from the <a href="https://github.com/adaman81/cnft-pavia-tools">releases</a> page

## Usage
- Enter your coordinates + radius
- Wait for it... can take a minute
- Disclaimer: very untested, I only used it for getting prices around the plaza :-)
- Green prices: currently on sale on (cnft.io)
- Red prices: sold for that amount recently (cnftanalytics.io)
