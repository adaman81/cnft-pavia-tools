# cnft-pavia-tools

Get price info on pavia.io lands!

- Enter your coordinates + radius
- Wait for it... can take a minute
- Disclaimer: very untested, I only used it for getting prices around the plaza :-)
- Green prices: currently on sale on (cnft.io)
- Red prices: sold for that amount recently (cnftanalytics.io)
- Installation: this was hacked together in Visual Studio .Net, so you need that to build it
